                    Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.

                    Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Never let anyone know what you are thinking.
